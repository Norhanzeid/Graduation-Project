# ECS
The elderly care system is an integrated system consisting of software, hardware, and AI techniques connected to the performance of some tasks to care for the elderly through Companions, which distinguishes this system and makes it different from most other medical systems.

# Problem
Blood pressure has been called the "silent killer." Most people with it are not aware of the problem as they may not have any warning signs or symptoms. 
For this reason, it is important to have your blood pressure measured regularly.

The only way to detect blood pressure is to have blood pressure measured in any specialized place. It is a quick and painless process. 
People can do this procedure themselves using electronic devices, but it is important that they undergo an evaluation by a specialist doctor for possible risks and associated ailments

# What are the risks that blood pressure can cause ?
Heart attack

Angina pectoris

Cardiac insufficiency OR Heart failure

Tachycardia, which can lead to sudden death.

High blood pressure can damage the kidneys, leading to kidney failure

Also, High blood pressure can also burst or block the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the brain, causing a stroke.

# Idea

The elderly care system is a medical system to follow up the patient’s health condition through one or more patient companions who follow up on the patient’s matters such as medications and vital signs and avoid major damage such as clots and others by sending an alert when a defect occurs in one of the readings such as blood pressure, heartbeat, etc. 
Because they cause serious symptoms 

# Goals

The system contains many features to facilitate the care of the elderly through

Predicting blood pressure via Ai model and alerting when a blood pressure disorder occurs Avoiding large side effects such as clots and dealing with them quickly through Transport to the hospital in time before more damage occurs.

Reading some vital signs and alerting the patient’s companion when a defect occurs in one of the readings and linking them to each other

it also contains some other features, such as the patient’s ability to communicate with companions via video call, follow-up and schedule medication appointments


# Importance
This system is designed to make life more efficient and flexible and to make it easier for the patient and companion who care for him.

This system makes a companion of the patient aware of all the vital signal of the patient, news, and changes that occur around him 

Make the companion of the patient abler to follow the patient's condition by scheduling the patient medicine and follow-up his vital simply without making an effort only using the elderly care system.

# third model is Brain Tumor Classfication

# Dataset contain 4 classes :

1-Glioma tumor

2- Meningioma tumor

3- No tumor

4-Pituitary tumor
